# Article Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete article detail page feature for the Manova mental wellness application. The implementation includes proper routing, click handlers, and fallback logic for articles with or without slug fields.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ArticleDetailPage Component (`src/pages/ArticleDetailPage.jsx`)
- **New component** that displays individual articles
- **Route parameter handling**: Uses `useParams()` to get the slug from URL
- **Dual fetch strategy**: 
  - First tries to find article by `slug` field in Firestore
  - Falls back to treating the slug as document ID if not found
- **Rich UI**: Includes article image, title, author, date, category, content, and tags
- **Error handling**: Shows appropriate error states for missing articles
- **Loading states**: Displays loading spinner while fetching data
- **Navigation**: Back button to return to articles list
- **Share functionality**: Native share API with clipboard fallback

### 2. Routing Configuration (`src/App.jsx`)
- **Added new route**: `/articles/:slug` 
- **Protected route**: Wrapped with `ProtectedRoute` component
- **Proper layout**: Uses `AppLayout` for consistent styling
- **Import added**: ArticleDetailPage component imported

### 3. Article Card Click Handlers (`src/pages/ArticlesPage.jsx`)
- **Card click**: Entire article card is now clickable
- **Read More button**: Separate click handler with event propagation prevention
- **Smart URL construction**: Uses `article.slug || article.id` for URL generation
- **Navigation**: Uses React Router's `navigate()` function

### 4. Slug Generation (`src/components/AddArticle.jsx`)
- **Auto-generation**: Slug automatically generated from article title
- **Form field**: Added read-only slug field to the form
- **Validation**: Proper slug formatting (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars)
- **User feedback**: Helper text explaining the auto-generation

## Technical Details

### URL Structure
- **Format**: `/articles/:slug`
- **Examples**: 
  - `/articles/mental-wellness-a-complete-guide`
  - `/articles/abc123def456` (document ID fallback)

### Data Fetching Logic
```javascript
// First: Try by slug field
const q = query(collection(db, 'articles'), where('slug', '==', slug));
const snap = await getDocs(q);

// Fallback: Treat as document ID
const docRef = doc(db, 'articles', slug);
const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);
```

### Slug Generation Algorithm
```javascript
title
  .toLowerCase()
  .replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '')  // Remove special chars
  .replace(/\s+/g, '-')          // Spaces to hyphens
  .replace(/-+/g, '-')           // Multiple hyphens to single
  .trim('-')                     // Remove leading/trailing hyphens
```
